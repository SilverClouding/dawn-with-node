  Gets called from image.liquid

  The srcset is generated by looping over the widths in the image_widths array
  We then generate the correct aspect ratio based on the dimensions passed through to this snippet
  The image URL then gets generated and the width appended so the browser can select which image to display
  We only generate images smaller than the two times width so as to reduce unnecessary image generation
